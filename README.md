# FlexRadioService

An API for integrating with a Flex 6xxx radio.

Simple REST API for discovering radios and connecting / disconnecting.

Simple CAT functions to support WSJT and simple loggers to get / set frequency mode
information and command the radio into and out of TX. CAT TCP ports are configurable and
can follow any slice along with the transmit or active slice. 

This has been written to solve some integration needs and is largely experimental at
this stage. The code functions for what has been implemented and will likely be expanded 
upon as further needs arise.
